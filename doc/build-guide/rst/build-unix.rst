Building on Unix
================

Run in ``./build`` folder::

	make

You might also want to add ``-j <n>`` to make use of multiple CPU cores and speed up build process, like::

	make -j 4

After Doxyrest build is complete ``doxyrest`` command line tool can be found in ``./build/doxyrest/bin/${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}``.

Note that with ``make``-based build changing configuration from ``Debug`` to ``Release`` should be done at CMake configuration step (Xcode and Visual Studio are multi-configuration build systems).
