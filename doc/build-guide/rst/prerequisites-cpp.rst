C++ Compilers
=============

Doxyrest is written in C++ so obviously you will need a C++ compiler and standard C/C++ libraries. The latest version of Doxyrest was built and tested on:

* Windows
	- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 version 10.0.40219.1 SP1Rel
	- cl version 16.0.40219.1

	Here in Tibbo we still use Visual Studio 2010 for building official Windows packages of our software (due to many issues with Visual Studio 2015: telemetry code injection scandal, noticeable slow-down of editor and debugger, largely increased size of generated temporaries etc).

	This being said, Doxyrest *should* build on newer versions of Visual Studio as well.

* Linux
	- GCC++ version 6.2.1
	- Clang++ version 3.8.1

* Mac OS X
	- Clang++ version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)

The above version numbers are provided for reference only. If the version of C++ compiler on your machine is higher or not too much lower, don't worry -- it will most likely compile everything just fine.
