Configuring
===========

Alright, all the necessary tools and libraries are available on your machine. What's next? As with every CMake-based project, we now need to *configure* our build and create appropriate makefiles.

However, there is an important difference with most CMake-based projects. Doxyrest build system does not rely on CMake ``find_package`` facility to find dependencies. Why not?

First of all - ``find_package`` simply does not work reliably on Windows. Here you would do need to set up an extra layer of path configuration variables and then provide these paths as *hints* to ``find_package``. This effectively **voids** the whole idea behind ``find_package`` -- it's you, not ``find_package``, who is doing the actual "finding"!

Another important reason -- ``find_package`` is not convenient to use in situations when you need to **switch** between different **versions** of the same library, between **Debug/Release** builds, between **static/dynamic** libraries, between different **processor architectures** during cross-compilation and so on.

In other words, ``find_package`` is really convenient on **Unix** systems when all you do is a **native** build with the **default** versions of installed tools and libraries. Need more flexibility? Then ``find_package`` alone is not the answer.
