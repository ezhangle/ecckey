Tools
=====

Doxyrest build system relies on its own path configuration so you do not actually need to add any of these tools to ``PATH``. However, it is recommended to make CMake easily available (e.g. via ``PATH`` or a shortcut to ``cmake-gui``) -- because it is used to initiate the whole build process.

Required Tools
--------------

These tools are **required** for building the Doxyrest:

* CMake 3.3 or above

	Doxyrest uses CMake-based build system. CMake is a cross-platform C/C++-centric build system which uses build scripts to generate platform-specific makefiles. CMake is quickly becoming a de-facto standard when it comes to building cross-platform C/C++ applications.

	CMake is available in official repositories of most Linux distributions. Source and pre-compiled binaries can also be directly downloaded from the official website: http://cmake.org

	Any version of CMake above 3.3 should work. Versions prior to CMake 3.3 improperly expand ``CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE`` variable which Doxyrest build system relies on.

Optional Tools
--------------

These tools are **optional** and only needed if you plan to build Doxyrest documentation:

* Python

	Doxyrest documentation uses Sphinx as a back-end, therefore, Python is also needed.

	Python is available out-of-the-box in most Linux distributions and Mac OS X. On Window you can install the official binaries available at: https://www.python.org
	or use ActivePython: http://www.activestate.com/activepython

	Both 3.5.x and 2.7.x branches should be fine (Sphinx documentation states that the required version is at least 2.6).

* Sphinx

	Doxyrest documentation uses Sphinx for generating HTML or PDF output.

	Sphinx is available via ``pip`` Python package management infrastructure. It should also be available in many Linux distributions as a stand-alone binary package.

	The official website of Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org
