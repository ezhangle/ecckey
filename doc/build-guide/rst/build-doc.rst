Building Documentation
======================

Doxyrest contains two documentation packages:

* Build guide
* Manual

If you have required :ref:`prerequisites <optional-tools>` for building documentation, CMake should have created all the necessary shell scripts under: ``./build/doc/<doc-package>``

``sphinx-build`` is always needed; ``pdflatex`` is also needed to build PDF.

Resulting HTML pages will be placed at: ``./build/doc/<doc-package>/html``

Resulting PDF will be placed at: ``./build/doc/<doc-package>/pdf``
