Libraries
=========

These libraries are **required** for building the Doxyrest.

* Lua

	Doxyrest uses Lua string templates for generating Re-Structured Text from Doxygen XML database. Therefore, Lua headers and libraries (not executables!) are required for building Doxyrest.

	Lua executables, header files and both static and dynamic libraries are available in official repositories of most Linux distributions.

	Lua sources, as well as the links to pre-compiled binaries (of both executables and libraries), could be found at the official Lua website: http://www.lua.org

	Both 5.2.x and 5.3.x branches should be fine.

* Expat

	Doxyrest uses Expat library for parsing XML.

	Expat header files and libraries are available in official repositories of most Linux distributions.

	On Windows and Linux you would need to build Expat from sources which could be downloaded from the official Expat website: http://expat.sourceforge.net

* AXL

	Doxyrest uses AXL as a general purpose C++ support library.

	AXL is a lightweight C++ library featuring:

	- Java naming convention;
	- non-zero-terminated UTF-8 string slices as a default string-passing model;
	- TLS-based error-handling system;
	- unified reference-counting model;
	- wrappers for many popular libraries;
	- and more...

	AXL is included in the recommended ``doxyrest_b`` bundle package. Therefore, if you build Doxyrest from ``doxyrest_b`` package, you don't have to do anything extra -- AXL will be built automatically during the build process.

	However, if you use the standalone ``doxyrest`` package, you will need to download and build AXL first.

	Sources of AXL are available at: http://tibbo.com/downloads/archive/axl
