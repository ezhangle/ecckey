Building on Windows
===================

To build Doxyrest on Windows you can start Visual Studio by double-clicking the newly generated solution file ``doxyrest_b.sln`` and build it from the IDE.

If you prefer building from the command line, run in ``./build`` folder::

	cmake --build .

You can pass extra command-line arguments to ``msbuild.exe`` using ``--`` switch. For example, if you want to have a multi-core build of ``Release`` configuration, run::

	cmake --build . -- /maxcpucount /property:configuration=Release

Please refer to ``msbuild`` documentation for more details on command-line parameters: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164311.aspx

After Doxyrest build is complete ``doxyrest`` command line tool can be found in ``./build/doxyrest/bin/$(Configuration)``.
